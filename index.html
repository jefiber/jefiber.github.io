      <h1>
        The construction of global warming
      </h1>
      <p>
        Climate warming, whatever one concludes about its effect on the earth, is insufficiently understood as a concept that has been constructed by scientists, politicians and others, argues David Demerrit, a lecturer in geography at King's College London, in an exchange with Stephen H. Schneider, a professor of biological sciences at Stanford University. Many observers consider the phenomenon's construction -- as "a global-scale environmental problem caused by the universal physical properties of greenhouse gases" -- to be reductionist, Mr. Demerrit writes. Yet "this reductionist formulation serves a variety of political purposes," including obscuring the role of rich nations in producing the vast majority of the greenhouse gases. Mr. Demerrit says his objective is to unmask the ways that scientific judgments "have both reinforced and been reinforced by certain political considerations about managing" global warming. Scientific uncertainty, he suggests, is emphasized in a way that reinforces dependence on experts. He is skeptical of efforts to increase public technical knowledge of the phenomenon, and instead urges efforts "to increase public understanding of and therefore trust in the social process through which the facts are scientifically determined." In response, Mr. Schneider agrees that "the conclusion that science is at least partially socially constructed, even if still news to some scientists, is clearly established." He bluntly states, however, that if scholars in the social studies of science are to be heard by more scientists, they will have to "be careful to back up all social theoretical assertions with large numbers of broadly representative empirical examples." Mr. Schneider also questions Mr. Demerrit's claim that scientists are motivated by politics to conceive of climate warming as a global problem rather than one created primarily by rich nations: "Most scientists are woefully unaware of the social context of the implications of their work and are too naive to be politically conspiratorial." He says: "What needs to be done is to go beyond platitudes about values embedded in science and to show explicitly, via many detailed and representative empirical examples, precisely how those social factors affected the outcome, and how it might have been otherwise if the process were differently constructed.

        New ways to look at the debate over globalization
      </h2>
      <p>
        Articles in the two magazines offer new ways to examine the debate over globalization. In "The American Prospect," Benjamin R. Barber writes that discussions about globalization have focused on businesses and governments -- excluding the role of citizen-led groups. Mr. Barber, a professor of political science at Rutgers University, cites numerous examples in which citizens have reshaped public debate worldwide, including the campaign against land mines, efforts to protect dolphins from the tuna industry, and the "microcredit" movement in which small loans are made to women in developing nations to help them start businesses. Such movements, Mr. Barber writes, are having a tremendous, positive impact, and deserve attention and support. At the same time, he cautions against overstating their import. "These transnational civic projects should not fool us into thinking that Amnesty International or Medecins are the equivalent in clout of AOL Time Warner" or the International Monetary Fund, he writes. In "Foreign Policy" meanwhile, Robert Wright, a visiting scholar at the University of Pennsylvania, asks whether globalization, in addition to creating wealth, is also creating happiness. Of course, he writes, Nike stockholders want their company to profit and the workers in Nike factories in developing nations want to put food on their tables. But "are those Nike stockholders really happier behind the wheel of a Mercedes-Benz S.U.V. than they would be driving a Hyundai Accent? Might some Indonesian factory workers be better off if they had never left the farm?" Mr. Wright asks. He cites evidence that globalization has indeed made people happier, both in some economically wealthy nations and some poor nations. In poor countries, he argues, greater economic wealth is not a zero-sum game because people "are attaining things -- decent nutrition, health care -- that raise their happiness level without reducing anyone else's." At the same time, Mr. Wright argues that a utilitarian approach to globalization might well slow it down a little while not trying to stop it or to seriously stall it -- goals that he suggests are "beyond our mortal capacity.

        How genetic engineering gained legitimacy
      </h3>
      <p>
        When scientists gathered in 1975 at the Asilomar Conference Center in California, the new field of genetic engineering took center stage. But self-interest was more evident than altruism at the conference, writes Susan P. Wright, a historian of science at the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor, and director of an international research project on biological warfare. "Asilomar was about fashioning a set of beliefs for the American people and their representatives in Congress that would allow scientists to pursue genetic engineering under a system of self-governance," she says. Organizers of the conference were far from politically neutral, Ms. Wright maintains. They wanted to persuade the American public -- alerted by the antiwar movement to the dangers of biological warfare -- that genetic engineering was under control, that scientists developing the technology knew what they were doing, and that the field was therefore in good hands. It was necessary, then, for the organizers to restrict the agenda of the conference, "excluding the awkward questions of biological warfare and human genetic engineering that molecular biologists obviously had no more claim to pronounce on than other people," says Ms. Wright. She argues that in order to show the public that the interests of the Asilomar conference were also the interests of society at large, the public had to be convinced that if the scientists regulated themselves, "the fruits of genetic engineering would benefit everyone." She notes that when Sen. Edward Kennedy proposed that decision-making authority be given to an independent commission (instead of to the National Institutes of Health), the biomedical researchers organized a massive lobbying effort against the move. The consequences of that effort? According to Ms. Wright, harmful applications have now advanced beyond the reach of national, or international, controls -- with biological warfare being the main example.
